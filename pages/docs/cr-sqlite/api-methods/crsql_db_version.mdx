# crsql_db_version

`crsql_db_version` returns the current lamport timestamp of the database. This value is incremented on every transaction made to the database and moved up to the `MAX(this_db_version, peer_db_version)` when syncing, in order to allow causal ordering of changes between databases.

## Usage

```sql
SELECT crsql_db_version();
```

Also: `SELECT crsql_next_db_version()` for the version to be assigned in the current transaction.
