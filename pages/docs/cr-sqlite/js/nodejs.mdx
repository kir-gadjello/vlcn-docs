# NodeJS

Given `cr-sqlite` is a run time loadable extension you can use it in `nodejs` with any `sqlite` bindings that you desire such as
[better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) or [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3).

## Example

```ts
import type { Database } from "better-sqlite3";
import SQLiteDB from "better-sqlite3";

// the crsqlite package exports the path to the extension
import { extensionPath } from "@vlcn.io/crsqlite";

const db: Database = new SQLiteDB('path-to-your-db');
// suggested settings for best performance of sqlite
db.pragma("journal_mode = WAL");
db.pragma("synchronous = NORMAL");
// load that extension with the `better-sqlite3` bindings
db.loadExtension(extensionPath);
```

## Usage

The API for interacting with the database will be the same as whatever `sqlite` bindings you chose. Creating conflict free tables and merging databases is done entirely over SQL. See the `cr-sqlite` [docs](/docs/cr-sqlite/api-methods/crsql_as_crr).

## Listening for changes & Networking

Listening to changes from the databases and creating a sync server are covered in:

- [Reactivity](./reactivity)
- [Networking](./networking)
