# Installation

`cr-sqlite` is distributed as a [run time loadable extension](https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html) for SQLite and can be used with any language that has SQLite bindings.

## Acquiring the extension

**Pre-built binaries** - You can download a pre-built binary for your platform from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/releases).

**Building from source** - You may also build from source by cloning the [cr-sqlite repository](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite) and following the instructions in the readme.

**Packages**

1. NodeJS & Deno - see [docs/nodejs](./js/nodejs)
2. Browser/WASM - see [docs/wasm](./js/wasm)

## Loading the extension

Once you've acquired the extension you'll need to load it into your SQLite connection. This is done by calling the `sqlite3_load_extension` function with the path to the extension and, optionally, the entrypoint of the extension.


<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
  If you downloaded a prebuilt binary it is recommended to rename it to `crsqlite.[dll/so/dylib]`. This follows SQLite's expected naming conventions for extensions.
  
  If you do not rename it, you will need to pass `sqlite3_crsqlite_init` as an argument to [`sqlite3_load_extension`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/load_extension.html).
</Callout>


<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
  You _must_ load the cr-sqlite extension into a connection before
  interacting with any CRRs on that connection.

  unsafe {
    conn.load_extension_enable()?;
    let r = conn.load_extension("/path/to/crsqlite", Some("sqlite3_crsqlite_init"))?;
    conn.load_extension_disable()?;
    r
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```js
  import SQLiteDB from "better-sqlite3";
  import { extensionPath } from "@vlcn.io/crsqlite";

  db = new SQLiteDB("my_database.db");
  db.loadExtension(extensionPath);
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```js
  import initWasm from "@vlcn.io/crsqlite-wasm";
  import wasmUrl from "@vlcn.io/crsqlite-wasm/crsqlite.wasm?url";

  const sqlite = await initWasm(wasmUrl);
  const db = await sqlite.open("my-database.db");
  // the extension is statically linked into the wasm build. No need to load it explicitly.
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Closing Connections

You should call `SELECT crsql_finalize();` before closing the database connection. This allows the extension to perform some cleanup before database shutdown. Failing to do so is not a critical error, but it may cause exceptions to be thrown when the connection is closed. The JS connection wrapper in the `crsqlite-wasm` package automatically does this for you when closing connections.

Example:

```js
conn.exec('SELECT crsql_finalize();');
conn.close();
```
