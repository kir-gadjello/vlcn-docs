# crr

CRR stands for [Conflict Free Replicated Relation](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02983557/document). In the context of vlcn & cr-sqlite, a CRR is a table that has had the [crsql_as_crr](/docs/cr-sqlite/api-methods/crsql_as_crr) operation applied to it.

E.g.,
```sql
CREATE TABLE items (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  age INTEGER
);

SELECT crsql_as_crr('items');
```

CRRs can be synced and merged between different databases. Regular tables (non-crrs) are just plain SQLite tables and cannot be synced or merged. They exist completely locally.
