# Recursive Ordering in SQLite

I previously talked about how you could order by relationships in [[blog/recursive-ordering]]. I didn't explain how you can actually implement this in a relational database and make it performant.

Lets say we've implemented a linked list in our table and want to retrieve items in the order that they are linked together.

The schema would look like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE node (
  id primary key NOT NULL,
  parent_id,
  content,
);
CREATE INDEX node_parent_id ON node (parent_id);
```

But how do we fetch nodes in order? We can't order by any of the fields nor will joins or subselects help us out here.

```sql
SELECT content FROM node ORDER BY ?????
```

We can, however, create a recursive common table expression.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE
after_node(content,level,id) AS (
  VALUES('Root',0,?)
  UNION ALL
  SELECT node.content, after_node.level+1, node.id
    FROM node JOIN after_node ON node.parent_id=after_node.id
   ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
SELECT content FROM after_node LIMIT ?;
```

What is happening above is that we're creating the ordered representation of the table by recursively following `parent_id` down to the provided root.

To get items after a given root, provide a different root id.

Using this query would look something like:

```ts
const stmt = sqlite.prepare(sql`
WITH RECURSIVE
after_node(content,level,id) AS (
  VALUES('Root',0,?)
  UNION ALL
  SELECT node.content, after_node.level+1, node.id
    FROM node JOIN after_node ON node.parent_id IS after_node.id
   ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
SELECT content FROM after_node LIMIT ?;
`);

// get the first 1k items in desc order
stmt.all(
  null, // the "root" id.
  1000 // first 1k items
);

// get the first 1k items after `some_id` in desc order
stmt.all(
  some_id,
  1000,
);
```

But how well does it perform?

## Benchmarking

Given we can [run SQLite in the browser these days](https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/index.md), lets fire it up and try it out.

<RunnableCode
code={`const sqlite3Import = await import("https://esm.sh/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm@3.41.2");
sqlite3InitModule = sqlite3Import.default;

const sqlite3 = await sqlite3InitModule();
const db = new sqlite3.oo1.DB();
db.exec([
  \`CREATE TABLE node (id NOT NULL, parent_id, content, primary key (id));\`,
  \`CREATE INDEX node_parent_id ON node (parent_id);\`
]);
provide db;`} />

Now lets populate 100k rows as our test set of data where each new row points to the previous row.

<RunnableCode
code={`use db;
function fill(db) {
  let lastId = null;
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {
    const id = i;
    db.exec(\`INSERT INTO node (id, parent_id, content) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\`, { bind: [
      id,
      lastId,
      "str" + i,
    ]});
    lastId = id;
  }
}
db.transaction(() => fill(db));`} />

Then prepare different statements to benchmarking recursive ordering vs normal ordering.

<RunnableCode
code={`use db;
const recursiveQuery = \`WITH RECURSIVE
  after_node(content,level,id) AS (
    VALUES('Root',0,?)
    UNION ALL
    SELECT node.content, after_node.level+1, node.id
      FROM node JOIN after_node ON node.parent_id IS after_node.id
    ORDER BY 2 DESC
  )
  SELECT content FROM after_node LIMIT ?;\`;

const recursiveStmt = db.prepare(recursiveQuery);
const regularQuery = \`SELECT content FROM node WHERE id > ? ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT ?\`;
const regularStmt = db.prepare(regularQuery);
const controlQuery = \`SELECT content FROM node WHERE content > ? ORDER BY content DESC LIMIT ?\`;
const controlStmt = db.prepare(controlQuery);

provide recursiveStmt;
provide regularStmt;
provide controlStmt;`} />

And finally, run the benchmarks.

<RunnableCode
code={`use recursiveStmt;
use regularStmt;
use controlStmt;

function fetchAll(stmt, bindings) {
  let numRows = 0;
  stmt.bind(bindings);
  // computing numRows just as a check that we're getting rows back as expected from
  // each query
  while (stmt.step()) {
    ++numRows;
  }
  stmt.reset(true);
  return numRows;
}

function time(fn) {
  const start = performance.now();
  const ret = fn();
  const end = performance.now();
  return [ret, (end - start).toPrecision(4) + "ms"];
}

return {
    "a - control sort first 10k": time(() => fetchAll(controlStmt, ["str0", 10000])),
    "a - regular sort first 10k": time(() => fetchAll(regularStmt, [0, 10000])),
    "a - recursive sort first 10k": time(() => fetchAll(recursiveStmt, [null, 10000])),
    "b - control sort mid 10k": time(() => fetchAll(controlStmt, ["str50000", 10000])),
    "b - regular sort mid 10k": time(() => fetchAll(regularStmt, [50000, 10000])),
    "b - recursive sort mid 10k": time(() => fetchAll(recursiveStmt, [50000, 10000])),
    "c - control sort last 10k": time(() => fetchAll(controlStmt, ["str90000", 10000])),
    "c - regular sort last 10k": time(() => fetchAll(regularStmt, [90000, 10000])),
    "c - recursive sort last 10k": time(() => fetchAll(recursiveStmt, [90000, 10000])),

    "d - control sort first 5k": time(() => fetchAll(controlStmt, ["str0", 5000])),
    "d - regular sort first 5k": time(() => fetchAll(regularStmt, [0, 5000])),
    "d - recursive sort first 5k": time(() => fetchAll(recursiveStmt, [null, 5000])),
    "e - control sort mid 5k": time(() => fetchAll(controlStmt, ["str50000", 5000])),
    "e - regular sort mid 5k": time(() => fetchAll(regularStmt, [50000, 5000])),
    "e - recursive sort mid 5k": time(() => fetchAll(recursiveStmt, [50000, 5000])),
    "f - control sort last 5k": time(() => fetchAll(controlStmt, ["str90000", 5000])),
    "f - regular sort last 5k": time(() => fetchAll(regularStmt, [90000, 5000])),
    "f - recursive sort last 5k": time(() => fetchAll(recursiveStmt, [90000, 5000])),
};`} />

On a macbook m1, recursive sort is about 2x slower than regular sort in all cases and between 8-12x faster than the control.

The "2x slower **in all cases**" is also a good sign -- it means that the perf of a recursive sort tracks that of a run of the mill sort on an indexed column by a constant factor.

Each recursive case also took the same amount of time meaning it doesn't matter from where we start fetching a range from within a large table.

While it is a 2x hit, it is still incredibly quick. On my m1 -- 10ms to return 10k rows in order from a set of 100k.

## Pros

- While slower than a fractional index, it is still very fast / is only a constant factor slower than a regular index.
- Does not lose precision as a fractional index does. See [articles/fractional-indexing](./fractional-indexing)
- Does now blow up in storage space as a fractional index can. See [articles/fractional-indexing](./fractional-indexing)
- Inserting or moving a row only requires updating at most 3 rows. See [articles/recursive-ordering](./recursive-ordering)

## Drawbacks

- The implementation shown here cannot be used in a distributed setting where nodes write without coordination. To solve this, see [articles/distributed-recursive-ordering](./distributed-recursive-ordering).
